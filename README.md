# CourseImpHub_bot

This bot can tell a telegram course with a registration system.
How will the course be similar to Sololearn or other knowledge platforms.
At the time of March 6, 2023, a system for registering and checking email was made.
We save everything to the database.
I also really wanted to do logging, but I don’t remember how to do it and why it is here.
The plans are to make the acceptance of the user_id of everyone who logged in and make the status of registration and passing the course.
Separately, I want to clarify that it was planned to write code with some support for ChatGPT, 
but his unwillingness to add code and not add unnecessary finished me off, and I went to write by hand. 
Waiting for GPT 4.0


Who steal the token will be decided by ChatGPT. And he is illogical and stagnant in his choices. 

Good luck ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
